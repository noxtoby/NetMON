NetMON — Network Models Of Neurodegeneration
============================================

This project was made possible by the Biomarkers Across Neurodegenerative Diseases (BAND) initiative funded jointly by four charities: The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Research UK, and Weston Brain Institute.

This repository contains source code I developed during NetMON (2016–2018).

PPMI Merge
----------

I created a python script to merge useful tables in the PPMI dataset: [ppmi_merger.py](ppmi_merger.py)

This is analogous to `adni_merger.R` for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative available here: https://adni.bitbucket.io/

Connectome pipeline
-------------------

[connectome_pipeline](connectome_pipeline) contains the source code, and instructions (see `.tex` file), for the anatomical connectome pipeline I used in the following paper:
